Agent-Based Modelling (ABM) is applied successfully in various use cases, including but not limited to economic modelling, socio-behavioural modelling, ecological modelling, public health, and urban design. We draw attention to the emerging ABM platform Agents.jl, written in Julia — an accessible, high-level programming language. We identify Agents.jl as a promising package for interfacing, customising and extending for specialised uses. We present the key design ideas for a proposed extension and interface to the Agents.jl framework for ABM for urban and social systems simulation — AgentsX.jl — that provides greater flexibility of agent definitions for urban and social researchers. Our primary motivation is to formalise ABM design through a “Code as the Model” approach, reducing barriers to documentation and increasing reproducibility. Our proposed design entails a structured means of defining an ABM based on layers modelled after spheres of influence, clearer constructs to coding an ABM as interfaces to Agents.jl, and an insightful visualisation toolkit that uses dimension reduction techniques.

  abstract={The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically changed human lifestyles, with implications on many aspects of human life. With the proliferation of masks to combat the spread of the virus, many computer vision workflows have been inadvertently affected to varying degrees. Consequently, many research articles have been dedicated to evaluating the impact to existing facial imagery recognition problems. Several works have attempted to either extend existing facial models or develop new techniques specific to masked faces. Many new benchmark tasks have also been introduced in this subdomain. However, a detailed review of such advancements is not available for perusal in this critical area for COVID-safe protocol development. In this work, we address this issue as the first review of masked facial recognition tasks and techniques robust to masked facial images. Our motivation is to provide a central reference for automated public health and COVID-safe identification protocols while also exploring the ethical aspects of further development of such techniques.},

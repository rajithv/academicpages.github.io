Hello, I am Rajith!

I primarily work as a Researcher at the [Transport, Health, and Urban Development (THUD) Research Lab](https://thud.msd.unimelb.edu.au/) at the Melbourne School of Design (MSD), University of Melbourne. I work with Agent-Based Models and research how to make them better!

I am also an educator at the [Department of Mechanical Engineering](https://mechanical.eng.unimelb.edu.au/), University of Melbourne, where I am the head-tutor for AI for Engineering, and Numerical Methods in Engineering subjects.

This website is still under construction - I apologise for the sparcity while I populate the content in my spare time.

## My Research

I primarily work with Agent-Based Models to analyse complex scenarios across various domains, including health, transport and social science. My research interests include fair and ethical AI, optimisation and pattern recognition and community analysis. I am interested in supervising projects related to above research interests.

## My Teaching

I am an avid educator and have always enjoyed sharing my knowledge with the next generation. I have extensive teaching/training experience in data structures and algorithms, as well as in subjects related to AI. Currently, I manage a tutoring team at the [Department of Mechanical Engineering](https://mechanical.eng.unimelb.edu.au/), University of Melbourne, as the head tutor for "MCEN90048: AI for Engineering". I am also an [Associate Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (AFHEA)](https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/fellowship/associate-fellowship).


## My Background

I recieved my PhD from the [College of Engineering and Computer Science](https://cecs.anu.edu.au/) of the [Australian National University](https://anu.edu.au). For my PhD I analysed microbial community behaviour analysis. After my PhD, I started using my community behaviour analysis on human societies, coupled with Agent-Based Modelling techniques. I recieved my Bachelors of Science in Engineering from the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](http://www.cse.mrt.ac.lk/), University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka. I have trained and worked as a Software Engineer for a short period as well.

## My Non-Academic Interests

In my spare time, I engage in a variety of hobbies. 

- COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdowns in Melbourne made me an artist, mostly working with watercolours; I sometimes sell my art, but yet to earn a profit with it! You can check my work on my [instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/rajith.art/).

- A life-long hobby of mine has been learning languages - both classical and contemporary. I speak a few with various degrees of fluency.
